# KnittingPlayer
A set of Javascript programs to help in knitting
Runs on a browser, using a web interface

The main link can be found at https://nadezdakataeva.github.io/KnittingPlayer/

This fork is however a total rewrite, done by Vladimir Kataev. To-do list is below

## Minimum viable changes:
- Create a functioning webpage
- Javascript up a table interface
- Javascript up onclick events to be able to click for interfacing
- Add an iterator that plays noises and iterates at different speeds

## bonus:
- Clipboard for broader copy-pasting
- String importing/exporting
